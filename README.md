## quick-start-gatsby-template

I spend a lot of time configuring a fresh Gatsby project to include testing, SASS support, typescript and prettier configurations. This boiler plate contains a freshly installed Gatsby project that has all of these functionalities including some utility styles and functions I use to keep my code responsive.

## Running in development

```
yarn

yarn test

yarn start
```
